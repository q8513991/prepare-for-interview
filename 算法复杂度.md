Some of the most common instances of Big O are listed below:
(n is a measure of the size of the inputs to the function. k, c are constants.)

* O(1) denotes constant running time.
* O(n) denotes linear running time.
* O(log2nlog2n) denotes logarithmic running time.
* O(nlog2nnlog2n) denotes log-linear running time.
* O(nknk) denotes polynomial running time.
* O(cncn) denotes exponential running time.
